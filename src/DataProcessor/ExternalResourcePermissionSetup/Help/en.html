<p>Security profiles are a mechanism implemented in 1C:Enterprise 8.3 platform that allows to control how the infobases use external (relative to 1C:Enterprise server clusters) resources, such as file system directories, COM objects (for Windows-based systems), and external (relative to application) software modules based on 1C:Enterprise scripts (such as external reports and data processors, <strong>Execute</strong> and <strong>Evaluate</strong> method calls), external components, operating system applications, and Internet-based resources. Security profiles can be used to isolate any infobase and to block it from using any external resources not permitted by administrator explicitly.</p>
<p>Prevous versions of the platform required full access to external reports and data processors to be allowed in the security profiles. In the latest version, this limitation was removed, making it possible to specify stricter external resource use permissions for external code (including code for external reports and data processors) than for infobases.</p>
<p>Now permissions to access external (relative to 1C:Enterprise server cluster) resources are managed automatically. Administrator is no longer required to manually maintain the list of external resources necessary for the application to operate. Instead, whenever the application requests access to an external resource, a dialog is displayed with the <a href="DataProcessor.ExternalResourcePermissionSetup.Form.ExternalResourcePermissionSetup/Help">list of required permissions</a>. If the requested permissions are approved by the administrator, they will be added to the security profile in server cluster automatically. The security profiles generated for applications are as strict as possible (for example, <strong>Full access to external reports and data processors</strong> check box is unchecked by default).</p>
<p>When working with thin client under Linux, it is necessary to install RAS administration server in order to enable automated permission management for security profiles. When working under Windows, two options are avaiable: either using RAS administration server, or implementing COM-based connection.</p>
<p>To enable automated permission management, set <a href="DataProcessor.ExternalResourcePermissionSetup.Form.SecurityProfileSetup/Help"><strong>Security profile usage mode</strong></a> in<strong> Administration - Support and maintenance - Security</strong> section. </p>
<p>Security profiles are only available to owners of CORP client and server licenses for 1C:Enterprise 8 platform.</p></body></html>
