<p>This form is used to display progress and view results of deferred <a href="DataProcessor.InfobaseUpdate/Help">infobase updates</a>. </p>
<p>When performing infobase version updates, you may choose to have some of the data updated in deferred mode, i.e. in background, without service interruption. In this mode, the documents that have not been processed yet will become temporarily unavailable. Any attempt to open such a document will fail and display a message informing the user that the document is temporarily blocked until infobase version update is complete. Some reports may also become unavailable for the duration of the update. Any attempt to create such a report will display a warning informing the user that reports generated during the version update procedure may contain invalid data.</p>
<p>The form, as well as the <a href="&lt;span class=" a1ctranslator_highlight1="">CommonForm.ApplicationReleaseNotes/Help"&gt;Update details</a> (What's new) window, opens automatically as you log on to the application after infobase update. </p>
<p>You can also access information on the deterred update results by executing the <strong>Update results and additional data processors</strong> command located in the <strong>Administration - Support and maintenance</strong> section. Alternately, you can access this information by clicking the <strong>Additional data processors required</strong> hyperlink located in the <strong>What's new</strong> window. Once data processing starts, the hyperlink will change to <strong>Additional data processors in progress</strong>. </p>

<p>Data processors often take a long time to complete (from several minutes to hours, depending on volume of data stored in the application and computer performance). Moreover, while data processors are running the user experience may suffer. We recommend that you schedule the data processors to run during the minimum user activity periods, by setting up the <strong>Deferred infobase update</strong> scheduled job. </p>
<ul><li>To set up execution of the <strong>Deferred infobase update</strong> scheduled job, click <strong>Set schedule</strong>.
