<p>This list contains accounts of "outside" users working with the application. Generally, access rights granted to these users are very limited. External users do not actively input data, work separately, and do not interact with each other. Examples of external users: employees in HR database, online store customers, questionnaire responders, etc.</p>
<p>You can access the external user list via<strong> </strong>the <strong>Administration - User and rights settings </strong>section. It can also be accessed via section <strong>Questioning (Access management)</strong>. </p>
<p>External users of different types can access the same application; therefore, information on external users can be distributed between multiple application lists.</p>
<p>Only administrator and external user list manager can edit the external user list. </p>
<p>Application logon cannot be performed without administrator's approval.  </p>
<p>External user list manager can edit <strong>External users</strong> list (to a limited degree), configure external users prior to their logon approval by administrator. The list manager can use <strong>External access</strong> command, edit <strong>External users </strong>and<strong> External user groups</strong> lists. </p>
<p>External users created by the external user list manager are assigned<strong> Prepared</strong> status. Application adiminstrator can easily identify external users by this parameter, verify accuracy of the entered data, and permit application logon.</p>
<p>Once the administrator approves logon for an external user, the user list manager will be unable to change their logon settings in any way, with the exception of revoking the logon approval.</p>
<p>External users are only allowed to view their own personal data, or edit personal parameters such as their password, application interface language, or contact information.</p>
<p>In a distributed Infobase, application logon is configured for each infobase separately.</p>
<h3>Creating external users</h3>
<ul><li><strong>External access</strong> command is the primary tool for creating and modifying external users. This<strong> </strong>command is located in the command bar of each corresponding applied object or list. The command creates a new external user linked to the selected object, or displays information on an existing external user. 
</li><li>You can also create an <a href="Catalog.ExternalUsers.Form.ItemForm/Help">external user</a> directly in the user list. Click <strong>Create</strong>. In this case, you will need<strong> </strong>to specify <strong>Object</strong> linked to the external user you want to create.</li></ul><h3>Available commands</h3>
<ul><li>Any external user can be marked as "not valid". To view the list of these external users, click <strong>All actions - Show not valid external users. </strong>
</li><li>If you need to check external user data accuracy or modify incorrect external user data, use command <strong>All actions - Infobase users</strong> to check records or synchronize external user list and <a href="Catalog.Users.Form.InfobaseUsers/Help">Infobase user</a> list.</li></ul><h3>Grouping external users</h3>
<p>If the application supports user groups, the list will consist of two sections. Groups are displayed on the left, external users - on the right. When you select a group, all external users belonging to this group will be displayed in the right section.</p>
<p>Long lists of external users can be grouped for your convenience. Grouping can be performed, for example, based on user relation types: partners, counterparties, etc. </p>
<p>An external user can belong to multiple <a href="Catalog.ExternalUserGroups/Help">groups</a>. To add an external user to a user group, you can use any of the following methods:</p>
<ul><li>When creating an external user, select a group from the list and click<strong> Create. </strong>
