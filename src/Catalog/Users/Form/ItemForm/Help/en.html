<p>Describing user properties.</p>
<p>To<a href="#1"> enter or edit</a> user data, you need administrator-level rights or <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">user list</a> management-level rights. </p>
<p>Application logon cannot be performed without administrator's approval. </p>
<p>User list manager can edit user list (to a limited degree), configure users prior to their logon approval by administrator, edit <strong>Users</strong> and <strong>User groups</strong> lists, and edit user access rights.</p>
<p>All other users are only allowed to view their own personal data, edit their contact information<strong>, </strong>change their <strong>Password</strong> (if permitted by administrator settings), or select application interface language.</p>
<p>In a distributed Infobase, application logon is configured for each infobase separately.</p>
<h3>Recommendations on creating logon passwords</h3>
<p>A strong password should:</p>
<ul><li>not be human-readable 
</li><li>be at least 8 characters long 
</li><li>include: 
<ul><li>uppercase Latin letters 
</li><li>lowercase Latin letters 
</li><li>numeric characters 
</li><li>special characters (underscore, brackets, etc) </li></ul></li></ul><p>The password should not be similar to user name, contain numeric characters only, actual words, or periodic character sequences. </p>
<ul><li>Good password examples:<br>“nj7{jhjibq*Gfhjkm, <br>F5”njnGhkmNj;t{HI. 
</li><li>Bad password examples: <br>Smith, <br>qwerty, <br>12345678, <br>123123123.</li></ul><h3><a name="#1">Creating users (</a>only for users with sufficient rights)</h3>
<p>When the user list manager creates a new user and specifies their logon name, administrator will be recommended to verify logon settings. Once the administrator approves logon for this user, the recommendation will be hidden and the user list manager will be unable to change the logon settings in any way, with the exception of revoking the logon approval. To view the list of users created by the manager, use filter by the<strong> Prepared by</strong> field. User data is broken into two tabs: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Main properties</strong>  
<ul><li>Enter<strong> Full name</strong> of user. This name will be displayed in a variety of application lists and reports.  
</li><li>The <strong>Not valid </strong>check box is cleared for all users by default. If a user is no longer working with the application for any reason (for example, they resigned), yet cannot be deleted (for example, due to being referenced by other applied objects), it is recommended that you select the <strong>Not valid</strong> check box for them. <strong>Not valid</strong> users are not displayed in the user list, and they cannot be selected, for example, as task performer or person responsible for a document. If you need to restore the user to valid status (for example, they have been rehired), simply clear this check box. 
</li><li><strong>Name (for logon) - </strong>short name used for application logon. Not required to be identical to the full name (a user can have short name "Smith" and long name "John Smith"). 
</li><li><strong>1C:Enterprise authentication</strong> - by default, check box is selected and password field is active. 
</li><li><strong>Password</strong> - enter application logon password. This field must not be blank for security purposes.  
</li><li><strong>Password confirmation</strong> - enter the password again to make sure it was typed correctly. 
</li><li><strong>Show in list - </strong>select this check box if you want this user to be displayed in the selection list available at application start. If any external users are registered in the application, selecting this check box is not recommended. If this check box is cleared, this user will not be displayed in the selection list available at application start. 
</li><li><strong>User cannot change password</strong> - select this check box to block a user from changing their password, if necessary. 
</li><li><strong>OpenID authentication</strong> - select this check box to allow a user to use unified logon protocol OpenID. This option is used when working with 1C:Enterprise web client. In this case, <strong>1C:Enterprise authentication</strong> check box must also be selected for the application to operate correctly. 
</li><li><strong>OS authentication - </strong>select this check box for quick and easy application logon. 
<ul><li>in <strong>User</strong> field, click button <img src="StdPicture.Select"></img> to <a href="Catalog.Users.Form.OSUserSelectionForm/Help">select</a> user name to be used for OS logon. This name will be also used for application logon. In this case, you can uncheck <strong>1C:Enterprise authentication</strong> check box.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Start mode</strong> - filled automatically by default (<strong>Auto</strong>). This mode is recommended.</li></ul></li><li>
<p><strong>Addresses, phones</strong> </p>
<ul><li>
<div>Enter user <a href="../id5d9c0841-6ea6-48dc-a53b-9f19894750f8/038b5c85-fb1c-4082-9c4c-e69f8928bf3a">contact information</a> required by the application (phone number, email address, etc).</div></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Adding users to groups</h3>
<p>If the application supports user groups, you can add the user to one or several user groups immediately during user creation procedure.</p>
<ul><li>Click<strong> Groups</strong> on navigation panel. Select one or several <a href="Catalog.UserGroups/Help">groups</a> using check boxes. 
</li><li>To clear all selections quickly, click <strong>Exclude from all groups.</strong></li></ul><h3>User access rights </h3>
<p>You can use one of the following methods to set up access rights:</p>
<ul><li>Click<strong> Access rights</strong> on navigation panel to add a user to one or more access groups. Select the required groups from list. 
</li><li>In the <strong>Allowed actions (roles) </strong>list, you can assign one or several roles to a user, thus defining their personal access rights. Some roles may correspond to job functions or duties, some - to more specific functions.  
<ul><li>Select the roles you need to assign via check boxes. 
</li><li>To hide roles you do not need, click <strong>Selected roles only</strong>. 
</li><li>For your convenience, roles can be sorted alphabetically or <strong>By subsystems.</strong></li></ul></li></ul><h3><a name="#2">Allowing application logon (for adiminstrator only)</a> </h3>
<li>To allow a user to logon to the application, select the <strong>Access to infobase allowed</strong> check box. and provide the required information: logon name, password, and other authentication parameters. 
<h3>Managing user settings</h3>
<p>Individual <a href="DataProcessor.ApplicationUserSettings.Form.ApplicationUserSettings/Help">settings</a> of each user are saved by the application for further use. To view, copy, or clear user settings (clearing may be required, for example, when invalid settings prevent normal application use), <strong></strong>click <strong>Settings</strong> on navigation panel.</p>
<h3>Application warnings</h3>
<p>If user properties differ from the <a href="Catalog.Users.Form.InfobaseUsers/Help">Infobase user</a> properties, the application will display a warning including the list of differences. This list should be saved in order to reconcile the differences.</p>
