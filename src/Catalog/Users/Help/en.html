<p>This list is used to manage users of the application. </p>
<p>You can access the user list via the <strong>Users</strong> command in <strong>Administration - User and rights settings</strong> or <strong>Access management </strong>section. </p>
<p>Only administrator and user list manager can edit the user list. </p>
<p>Application logon cannot be performed without administrator's approval.</p>
<p>User list manager can edit user list (to a limited degree), and configure users prior to their logon approval by administrator. User list manager also can edit <strong>Users</strong> and <strong>User groups</strong> lists. </p>
<p>All other users are only allowed to view their own personal data, edit their contact information, change their password, or select application interface language. </p>
<p>Users created by the user list manager are assigned<strong> Prepared</strong> status. Application adiminstrator can easily identify external users by this parameter, verify accuracy of the entered data, and permit application logon.</p>
<p>Once the administrator approves logon for an external user, the user list manager will be unable to change their logon settings in any way, with the exception of revoking the logon approval.</p>
<p>In a distributed Infobase, application logon is configured for each infobase separately.</p>
<p>Lists containing large numbers of users can be grouped for convenience. For example, users can be divided into <a href="Catalog.UserGroups/Help">groups</a> in accordance with corporate organizational structure.</p>
<h3>Creating users</h3>
<ul><li> Click <strong>Create</strong> and <a href="Catalog.Users.Form.ItemForm/Help">fill in</a> the required fields.</li></ul><h3>Available commands</h3>

<p>If the application supports user groups, the list will consist of two sections: groups listed on the left, and users belonging to the selected group - on the right. The <strong>All users</strong> group is specified as current group by default (all application users are displayed).</p>
<p>A user can belong to multiple groups. To add a user to a group, you can use any of the following methods:</p>
<ul><li>When creating a user, select a group from the list and click<strong> Create. </strong>
</li><li>To quickly add multiple users to a group, open the group window and click<strong> Pick</strong>. The users will be picked from the <strong>Users</strong> <a href="#S">list</a> containing three sections. 
</li><li>Select a user in the user list, execute the<strong> All actions - Assign groups</strong> command, and check the corresponding check boxes to include the user into one or more groups. This command is also available via context menu accessed by right-clicking. 
</li><li>Drag the users to the corresponding group. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm. Before using this feature, you need to clear the <strong>Show users of subordinate groups </strong>check box.</li></ul><h3>Creating user groups</h3>
