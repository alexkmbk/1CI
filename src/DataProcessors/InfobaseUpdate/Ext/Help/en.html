<p>Two complementary infobase update methods are available for your convenience:</p>
<ul><li>
<div>using exclusive processors:</div>
<ul><li>
<div>all users are locked out of the application.</div>
</li><li>
<div>this method is used to update data that must be fully processed prior to the users logging back on.</div>
<ul><li>
<div>the less data volume, the shorter downtime.</div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>
<div>using deferred processors:</div>
<ul><li>
<div>user are free to log on and work.</div>
</li><li>
<div>this method is used to update the infobase "data archive" (i.e. data not actively accessed by the users, or data that can be accessed by the users while the update is running).</div></li></ul></li></ul><p>Once the application update (in <strong>Designer </strong>mode, or using the <strong>Configuration update</strong> wizard available in basic versions) is complete, the application must be started for the first time on behalf of the administrator. During this first run, the application will finalize certain update procedures, which could take a long time (depending on the update scope and computer performance).</p>
<p>We recommend that you terminate all user sessions before running the application for the first time after update. This is necessary for correct application update.</p>
<p>If any user sessions are still open, you can <a href="../id2a479b8f-7569-43d0-8ca3-9001d6ec57f0/038b5c85-fb1c-4082-9c4c-e69f8928bf3a">terminate the active user sessions</a> in file mode, and lock the application temporarily (if you attempt to start the application in client/server mode, the start will be canceled and "active user sessions detected" message will be displayed). Click the hyperlink to view the <a href="../idfa33387e-184b-4c81-9ddf-e0c13b68730b/038b5c85-fb1c-4082-9c4c-e69f8928bf3a">list of active users</a> and ask them to log off, or click <strong>Terminate sessions and retry</strong> to continue with the infobase update. </p>
<p>After that, the application will start preparing to terminate the active user sessions. All active users will be asked to log off. The application will then lock as scheduled, and version update procedure will resume. </p>
<p>However, the application will not shut down; it will continue running displaying<strong> Application update </strong><a href="DataProcessor.InfobaseUpdate.Form.InfobaseUpdateProgressIndicator/Help">message</a> on an empty desktop. The message includes the updated infobase version. The indicator displays infobase update progress - both visually and as a percentage. To view detailed information on the infobase update progress, click the <strong>Technical details on update progress</strong> hyperlink located in the <a href="DataProcessor.EventLog/Help">event log</a>. </p>
<p>If an obsolete platform version is used, the application will display a message <a href="DataProcessor.NotRecommendedPlatformVersion.Form.NotRecommendedPlatformVersion/Help">requiring platform version update</a> and lock the desktop.</p>
<p>Once the infobase update is complete, the application will restart automatically. However, application desktop will be locked; to unlock it,  you will need to confirm that the update was <a href="../id19f690a3-d27b-43c1-94b7-585fc628da05/038b5c85-fb1c-4082-9c4c-e69f8928bf3a">legitimate</a>. After confirming this, you are free to start working with the application.</p>
<p>If any issues arise during the update, the application will display an <a href="DataProcessor.InfobaseUpdate.Form.UnsuccessfulUpdateMessage/Help">error message</a> asking you to contact technical support. To view the update error messages, click the <strong>More details in event log</strong> hyperlink. Users will not be able to resume working in the application.</p>
<p>Once the application update is complete, you can view the <a href="&lt;span class=" a1ctranslator_highlight1="">CommonForm.ApplicationReleaseNotes/Help"&gt;change notes</a> for the new version (available in the <strong>What's new</strong> window), view update-related technical events recorded in the <a href="DataProcessor.EventLog/Help">event log</a>, and start or monitor <a href="DataProcessor.InfobaseUpdate.Form.DeferredInfobaseUpdateProgressIndicator/Help">deferred data processing</a> (if available in the current application version). Afterwards, the <strong>What's new </strong>window will also be accessible via desktop. The application will unlock for all users.</p>
<h3>Features and advantages of deferred infobase updates</h3>
<ul><li>In client/server mode, application update may require additional data processors that should be executed in background to reduce downtime. Users can start working with the application before the processing is complete. White the update procedure is running, certain application functionality may be temporarily unavailable. 
</li><li>In this mode, the documents that have not been processed yet will become temporarily unavailable. Any attempt to open such a document will fail and display a message informing the user that the document is temporarily blocked until version update is complete. Some reports may also become unavailable for the duration of the update. Any attempt to create such a report will display a warning informing the user that reports generated during the version update procedure may contain invalid data.</li></ul><h3>Monitoring deferred updates</h3>
<p>If application update includes deferred background data processing, the administrator can monitor the deferred version update progress by executing the <strong>Update results and additional data processors</strong> command located in the <strong>Administration - Support and maintenance</strong> section. Alternately, you can access this information by clicking the <strong>Additional data processors</strong> in progress hyperlink located in the <strong>What's new</strong> window. </p></body></html>
